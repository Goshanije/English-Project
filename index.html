                <p class="detailed">The history of the creation of the park is connected with the fact that there were practically no cats left in besieged Leningrad.
                    With the disappearance of the animals, a huge number of rats appeared, which blocked the movement of trams, attacked people and posed a threat to the paintings in the Hermitage.
                    With the lifting of the siege of Leningrad, a collection of cats was announced throughout the country, only they could save the city from rodents. 
                    About 5,000 animals were sent from Siberia to the northern capital. Tyumen residents brought their pets to the assembly point for two weeks.</p>

Initially, the bridge was called a Pedestrian bridge, but after the collapse of a similar bridge in Voskresensk in 1988, it was examined and strengthened. 
                    There were benches on the bridge, but they were removed due to insufficient strength. In 2003, the Longest Kiss contest was held on the bridge, and after that the bridge was renamed the Bridge of Lovers.                    
                    In 2004, the bridge supports were equipped with a lighting system that takes into account passing vessels. In 2016-2017, major repairs and replacement of lighting with modern ones were carried out. The opening after renovation took place on July 29, 2017, on the City Day, with a grandiose light and music show.</p>
